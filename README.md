# Inverted Pendulum Modeling and Control with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Double Deep Q-Network

This project demonstrates, in the Jupyter Notebook file main.ipynb, how to reproduce the results of the paper Inverted Pendulum Modeling and Control with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Double Deep Q-Network. Due to the limited size of the paper, this repository presents data and graphs in more detail.

Retraining and reproducing all the results may take a few days. For this, Python requirements are available at the file requirements.yml. Trained reinforcement learning agents can be saved in Pickle files, but they can not be uploaded to GitHub due to file size limits.
